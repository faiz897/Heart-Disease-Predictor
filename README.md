# Heart-Disease-Predictor
Machine learning model which can predict a person having a heart disease or not.<br>
Binary classification model with supervised learning.

## Data 
The data on which the model will be trained has follows some features below:-
1. age
2. sex
3. chest Pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrrocardiographic result (values 0, 1, 2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. numbers of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3=normal, 6=fixed defect, 7=reversable defect
14. target: 0=not desease, 1=disease

This data set contains these features. If you want to know more about the data then you may visit the kaggle heart disease UCI https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci<br>

This data is also available for github users in the resources of the resporatory.
